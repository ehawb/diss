# About this repository
My name is Emily Hawboldt. This GitHub repository contains code to accompany my dissertation, "A machine learning approach to constructing Ramsey graphs leads to the Trahtenbrot-Zykov problem." My dissertation will be available at this webpage:
https://ir.library.louisville.edu/math_etd/ 

I am a mathematician who occasionally uses programming to solve problems, so I ask folks to keep that in mind as they use my code. I make no guaranteees that the code presented here is completely polished and error-free, and I welcome feedback that more experienced programmers might like to share with me. 

My dissertation has 7 chapters. Each chapter that uses code will require a different virtual environment that will be specified in the respective README. Even though not all of the chapters have code, I'm including the titles here in case they might spark interest.
## Chapter 1: Introduction
There is no code that accompanies Chapter 1. However, I did create some of the figures using the `tikz_tools` included here. I made my `nx_to_tikz` package back in the days of NetworkX 2.8. It seems that NetworkX 3.0 actually includes such a feature now! I haven't compared theirs with mine yet, but I'm including mine here for anyone who is curious.

## Chapter 2: Ramsey theory
No code for this chapter.

## Chapter 3: Reinforcement learning and Ramsey graphs
The code for this chapter is in the `ramsey` folder. There is a separate README there with instructions for how to use the code.

## Chapter 4: The Trahtenbrot-Zykov Problem
The code for this chapter is in the `TZ_tree_search` folder. There is a separate README there with instructions for how to use the code.

## Chapter 5: The undecidability of the Trahtenbrot-Zykov problem
No code for this chapter.

## Chapter 6: Cayley graphs
=======
The code for this chapter is in the `cayley` folder. There is a separate README there with instructions for how to use the code.

## Chapter 7: Conclusions
No code for this chapter.
