These 28 files contain the coloring data for the examples used to prove the lower bounds. 
In each file, the i'th entry in the j'th row gives the colour assigned to the edge ij.

For the two-color Ramsey numbers, the file name gXY.N gives a 2-coloring of the edges of K_n with no copy of K_X colored 0 and no copy of K_Y colored 1.

For the three-color Ramsey numbers, the file name gXYZ.N gives a 3-coloring of the edges of K_n with no copy of K_X colored 0, no copy of K_Y colored 1 and no copy of K_Z colored 2.

===========================

I converted these to .txt files, but the idea is the same. Files are named as gX_Y_N for two-color Ramsey, gX_Y_Z_N for three-color.
